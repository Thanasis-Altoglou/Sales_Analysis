# Sales_Analysis


## Overview:
In this project, Pandas and matplotlib libraries are used to analyze and solve real-world business questions about 12 months worth of sales data. The data includes hundreds of thousands of electronic product purchases broked down by month, data, product type, purchase address etc.

Data cleaning is performed at first place which includes:
1. Drop NaN values from the DataFrame
2. Remove rows based on a condition
3. Change the type of the columns

Since the data is cleaned up, the next phase is to explore the data to solve 5 business questions related to our data:
- What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
- What city sold the most product?
- What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
- What products are most often sold together?
- What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?
